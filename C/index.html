        <p>This experiment consists of three separate services.</p>
        <p>Each service has two instances.</p>
        <p>
            I was able to create some api gateway like feature where
            <a href="https://beta.maxzawisa.com/a/">https://beta.maxzawisa.com/a/</a> and
            <a href="https://beta.maxzawisa.com/b/">https://beta.maxzawisa.com/b/</a>
            use the same domain but different services.
